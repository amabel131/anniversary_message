        <p>I seriously can’t believe it’s one whole year already😫I can’t lie this past year has been one of the most beautiful chapters of my life,scratch that it’ll has the most beautiful chapter of my life
It’s been one year being with someone as amazing and unique as you,and words can’t express how grateful I am 
I’ll never forget that day I was in abk cus of jamb and u came,I had serious conversations with myself that day,I asked myself if I really wanted to do this,I asked myself if I’m sure I was doing the right thing or just falling prey,but at d end I just said scratch that😂💕I’ll follow my heart instead of my head and I’m extremely happy I made the right decision,cus if I ended up wrong ah🙂it wouldn’t have been funny at all o ajeh
We’ve been through so much together,many ups and downs in our personal life,we’ve been through times where our relationship almost fell apart,we’ve gone through the argument phase back and forth,and just look at us still together,one year being in love with each other,isn’t it like really suprising….
I actually never thought we’ll make it this far and I’m so glad we did,I didn’t want this to be another failed attempt and I’m just really happy we’re still here sticking up for and loving each other 
This is the first time I’ve come this far with someone and I don’t want this to end 
I want a future with you macquin
I want people to look at us and say Omo I thought they’ll have broken up by now but they’re still together 
I want people to say wait are they still together when they hear about us or see us
I want people to be envious of our relationship and what we have for each other 
I sincerely don’t want this to end it’ll really break me

I remember the first time u said u wanted to break up😂Omo I didn’t even know I’ll feel that bad ajeh…At first I was thugging it,I was telling myself why will u cry over someone u just started dating,but before I know water don full everywhere😂😂it felt like a light inside me was turned off,I think that was the day I knew that I wasn’t just in love,I was truly in love,I was attached and in way more than I thought I was,when u later apologized I had so many what ifs on my head that day,like what if this happens again and it ends up being for real,what if this boy is playing me and I’m just here falling and so many other what ifs
But I knew all that overthinking was a risk I had to take since my entire heart was already yours 

The love I have for you is way out of this world,it’s extraordinary 
And yet some people will say you can’t experience love when you’re young,I think we can both agree that a statement like that is bullshit and not facts
I mean I’ve experienced it first hand

You’ve seen me in ways no one else has
You’ve always been there for me;Cheering me up when I’m sad,cleaning my tears,helping me to stop think about my problems,you even give me solutions most of the time and for all these I’m more than grateful 
You’ve been the most supportive,caring,thoughtful,kind and generous partner and you’re fine as hell too🤭💞What more could I ask for?
Your kindness,patience,generosity,the way you always effortlessly make me laugh means so much to me
Thank you for coming into my life
Thank you for always listening to me 
Thank you for being my rock when I had nobody else to lean on
Thank you for loving me
Thank you for just existing

I can’t wait to see how our future will unfold
I can’t wait to watch you at your best
I can’t wait to see us be a great power couple achieving all our goals and dreams by each other’s side
I promise to continue loving you for as long as the earth stands
I promise that there’ll never be anyone that will share me with you
I promise to continue being loyal 
I promise that I’ll try my best to be the most amazing girlfriend on the planet 
I’ll always stand by you no matter the situation 
I’ll always cherish and love you 

Here’s to many more years of being the love of your life🥺💕
I TRULY LOVE YOU MACQUIN
HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
